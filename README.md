**ClearStock** is a production-ready, full-stack application designed for managing products, customers, orders, and inventory movement. Built originally as a technical assessment for Ethara AI, it has been heavily refined to feature an **industry-standard Enterprise OMS Light Theme** optimized for high data density, extreme readability, and transactional safety.

## ✨ Key Features

### 💻 Enterprise-Grade UI
- **Data-Dense Layout**: Clean, high-contrast light theme inspired by top-tier tools like Stripe and Shopify Polaris.
- **Tabular Readability**: Utilizes `JetBrains Mono` specifically for SKUs, Prices, and Order IDs to ensure perfect vertical alignment during rapid data entry.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Real-time notifications, interactive modals, and subtle state transitions without sacrificing performance.

### 🛡️ Robust Backend Logic
- **Transaction-Safe Inventory**: Utilizes database row-locking to ensure stock is reduced safely during concurrent order placements, completely preventing overselling.
- **Strict Validation**: End-to-end type safety and payload validation using Pydantic on the backend.
- **Relational Integrity**: Multi-table architecture enforcing unique constraints on SKUs and Customer Emails.

## 📡 API Reference

### Products
- `GET /products` - List all products
- `POST /products` - Create a new product (requires unique SKU)
- `PUT /products/{id}` - Update a product
- `DELETE /products/{id}` - Delete a product

### Orders
- `GET /orders` - List all orders
- `POST /orders` - Place a new order (automatically reduces inventory)
- `DELETE /orders/{id}` - Delete an order

### Dashboard
- `GET /dashboard/summary` - Fetch high-level metrics (Total Products, Customers, Orders, Low Stock Alerts)

**Sample Order Payload:**
```json
{
  "customer_id": 1,

      "product_id": 4,
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📈 Future Roadmap

- [ ] **JWT Authentication**: Secure API endpoints and add role-based access control (RBAC).
- [ ] **Alembic Migrations**: Implement schema version control for the PostgreSQL database.
- [ ] **Unit & Integration Testing**: Add `pytest` test coverage for core transactional logic.
- [ ] **Order Cancellations**: Add logic to safely cancel orders and automatically restore inventory stock.
